# Details

I like to go places I don't belong, so I was a natural fit for hacking and infosec. I enjoy making apps behave in ways they weren't designed as much as I enjoy providing readable, workable feeedback for clients in ways they can understand (something the USMC taught me). 

I do application, network, and systems security assessments and engineering for [Independent Security Evaluators](https://ise.io), a security consultancy. As part of my work, I publish blog posts whenever I have interesting findings or useful advice to share. 

Here, you can find some information about me, what I'm working on, and how to get a hold of me.
