*Hello.*

I like to hack SoHo (small-office home-office) routers for fun, and I’ve recently acquired the “WAVLINK AC1200 Dual Band WiFi Router,Gigabit Ethernet 1200Mbps High Speed Long Range 300 Mbps (2.4GHz)+867 Mbps (5GHz), Wireless Internet Router for Home Office”. You can take a look at the device for sale [here](https://www.amazon.com/WAVLINK-Extender-Coverage-1200Mbps-Wireless/dp/B07THZ9LBK/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=wavelink+router&qid=1599340954&sr=8-3).

This will be a three part blogpost. The first part  will be about publicly known vulnerabilities I found immediately. The second will be about anything I found on a deeper dive into the device’s file system. Post three will be a full audit of the device in accordance with OWASP IoT top vulnerabilities such as those listed [here](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project#tab=IoT_Top_10). 

To begin, a quick google search of the device brings up an interesting group of vulnerabilities:
* [/adm.cgi endpoint that processes commands without verifying their origin](https://vulmon.com/vulnerabilitydetails?qid=CVE-2020-10971&scoretype=cvssv2)
* [unauthenticated system information disclosure](https://vulmon.com/vulnerabilitydetails?qid=CVE-2020-12266&scoretype=cvssv2)
* [unauthenticated administrator password disclosure](https://vulmon.com/vulnerabilitydetails?qid=CVE-2020-10974&scoretype=cvssv2)

Unfortunately the actual exploitation of the issues is not well documented, so I decided to investigate this device to see for myself how they were exploited. First, I would need to interface with the device's on-board operating system.

To do that, we need to pop open the device and take a look at the circuit board. A lot of modern routers like to keep the top of its plastic shell in place with screws which they hide under some stickers. I found this router’s screws on the bottom of the plastic casing.

*Goodbye.*
