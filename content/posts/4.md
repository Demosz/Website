*Hello.*

Haven't posted in a while, but I think that's about to change since I started a firmware exploitation course from TacNetSol and Offsec's updated OSEP course. My current employer is pushing me to learn more about client-side attacks and evading passive defenses in a Windows environment so I can assist better with penetration tests, and I'm equally curious about binary exploitation in the MIPS architecture (which is what alot of IOT devices are built around). I think this should be fun since I'm already OSCP certified. I'll blog some about what I'm learning along with examples.

*Goodbye.*
