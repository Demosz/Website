*Hello.*

Haven't posted in a while, but I think that's about to change since I started Offsec's updated OSEP course. My job is pushing me to learn more about client-side attacks and evading passive defenses in a Windows environment so I can assist better with penetration tests. I think this should be fun since I'm already OSCP certified. I'll blog some about what I'm learning along with examples.

*Goodbye.*
